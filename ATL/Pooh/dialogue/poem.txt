  We shall not cease from exploration
  And the end of our exploring
  Will be to arrive where we started
  And know the place for the first time.
  Through the unknown, unremembered gate
  When the last of earth left to discover
  Is that which was the beginning;
  At the source of the longest river
  The voice of the hidden waterfall
  And the children in the apple-tree
  Not known, because not looked for
  But heard, half-heard, in the stillness
  Between two waves of the sea.

  - T.S. Eliot, Little Gidding
