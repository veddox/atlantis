OWL:
I have received a letter! Do you want to hear it?
Here, let me read it to you:
Hrrmpf, this is rather bad handwriting.
'Dear Pooh,'
Wait, this letter isn't to me at all?
Oh well, no matter. Ahem.
'I need to meet you urgently.
Come to see me at Galleon's Lap.
Sincerely, Christopher Robin'
There you go, what do you think about that?
