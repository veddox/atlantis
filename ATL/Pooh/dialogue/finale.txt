Christopher Robin runs towards you and hugs you.

CHRISTOPHER ROBIN:
I missed you, Pooh!
Come, I need to show you something.

He takes your hand and leads you to the highest point of Galleon's Lap.
You sit down in the grass and look around.

CHRISTOPHER ROBIN:
Look, Pooh, that is the world.
Isn't it huge? I want to see it all some day, you know.
We've been playing around the forest all our lives, but I want to see more.
But I'm scared, Pooh - scared of leaving you and Piglet and all the others.
I don't want to go, but I think it's time.
Just promise you won't forget about me, ever!
Not even when I'm a hundred.

He looks at you, and you nod solemnly.
Suddenly he laughs, and jumps up.

CHRISTOPHER ROBIN:
Come, let's go and play, Pooh!
This may be the end of one game, but another one is just starting!
