You have the feeling that you ought to be doing something.
You tap your paw against your head: Think Think Think!
You realize you haven't seen Christopher Robin in a long time.
How about visiting him again?
That sounds like a good idea.
You suddenly realize you are hungry.
Perhaps it would be better to have a little something before you go.
You go over to your cupboard to take out a jar of honey.
You open the cupboard door.
It's empty!
You pick yourself back up off the floor and tell your legs to behave.
You postpone your plans to visit Christopher Robin.
You first need to refill your honey stocks!
