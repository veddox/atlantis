|| Project ATLANTIS ||
======================


SUMMARY

Atlantis is a framework for creating an MUD world. It includes an interpreted
language for describing places, items, monsters and NPCs; provides networking
capabilities for multiplayer games and a text-based user interface. Inspired
and influenced by OpenWorld, it is written in Common Lisp.


GAME PLAY

The player navigates around the world using shell-like commands. He is immersed
into the game by DnD-like descriptive texts; new areas of the world can be
generated on the fly by the players themselves. It is a RPG, players aim to
develop their characters and can interact with other players.


TECHNICAL CHALLENGES

Networking: does Common Lisp support networking? threading? If not the latter,
			how can a real-time networked multiplayer game be implemented?

Implementation: presumably Atlantis will have to have a server-client model. 
				How do the two communicate? Are there alternative implementation
				models?

Language: how complex should the inbuilt language be? Is it a purely descriptive
		  language similar to XML/INI files? Should it be possible to script
		  actions with it? Must it be Turing complete?
