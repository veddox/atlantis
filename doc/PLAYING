======================
|| PLAYING ATLANTIS ||
======================

Atlantis is a platform for text-based adventure games. That means that you,
the player, interact with the computer using nothing but the keyboard and the
screen. (Well, and of course your imagination...)

This guide aims to give you a quick run-down of what you will need to know
to play Atlantis. If you are interested in more details, such as how to create
your own worlds, you are hereby referred to the accompanying documentation.

The current development version of Atlantis can be found at:
www.github.com/atlantis


THE MAIN MENU

This is where you find yourself when you first start Atlantis. Your options are
listed underneath the game banner. At the very bottom, you see the "command
prompt" (>>>), which is the indication that the computer expects some input from
you. In a menu like this, you can choose an option by typing the relevant number
and pressing ENTER. (Commands to the computer must always be terminated by
pressing ENTER.)

## TODO Include autosave!
	
The first option, "Start a new game", will first ask you for your name. (This is
needed to save the game.) It then drops you into a submenu in which you can
choose which game world you want to play. As of Atlantis 0.3, only the "Winnie
the Pooh" world is fully functional. (You can try the others, but they are far
from complete.)

The second option, "Load a saved game", is for players who have already started
a game in one of the worlds. (Your game progress is saved automatically.) Again,
you will be presented with a submenu that lists all currently saved games.

The third option is for developers and need not concern us further.

The fourth option displays this help text; the fifth option shows a copyright
notice and the Atlantis software license. The sixth option quits the game.


BASIC GAME PLAY

When you decide to start a new game in one of the game worlds, you may be
given a choice of characters to play. (Some worlds are only intended for a
single character. In that case, you are taken straight to the game.)

Once inside the game world, you no longer navigate using a numeric menu but with
commands. Most commands take the form <verb> <noun>, whereby <verb> is replaced
with the actual command (e.g. look) and <noun> is replaced with the object in
question (e.g. bed).

Typing "help" (without the quotation marks) will bring up a list of the core
commands, along with a short description. This is very useful!

If you want to stop playing, you can use the commands "quit" or "exit". Don't
worry, your game progress will be saved when you leave.

Note that although capitalization does not matter in Atlantis, spelling does.
So if you get an error message telling you that a command is not available, make
sure that you spelt it correctly.

However, having said that, Atlantis will try to guess the correct command from
an abbreviated input. The rules for this are pretty complex, but as long as your
input is unambiguous, Atlantis ought to be able to figure out what you meant.
(Example: Say you are in a room with an NPC called "young child". Then the
command "l child" will be expanded to "look young child". However, if there is
also a "crying child" in the room, "l child" is no longer unambiguous and will
now return an error.)


THE GAME SCREEN

All game worlds consist of a network of distinct places. Your current location
is always displayed at the very top of the screen. Below the location's name,
you will find a more detailed description of your surroundings. It's worth
reading this carefully, as it may contain important clues!

Underneath the place description are various lists, starting with neighbouring
places. There may also be items, NPCs (= non-playing characters) or even
monsters, all of which you can interact with.


CORE COMMANDS

Below you will find a list of the core Atlantis commands. Some places or items
may offer additional commands that are available when you are in that place
or in possession of the item. If any place/item provides commands, it is so
indicated in the game.

look - This is the most versatile command in the game. With it, you can inspect
       any item, NPC or monster (e.g. look cook). You can also bring up
       information about yourself with "look me" or about your current location
       with "look here".

goto - The second most important command in Atlantis. With "goto" you can change
       your location to a neighbouring place. Enter the name of the place you
       wish to go to after the actual command (e.g. goto Kitchen).

search - Some rooms contain hidden items. To find them, you first need to search
         the room. When you do so, you have a 50% chance of finding a hidden
         object.

take - This command is used to pick up an item. Most items in the game can be
       picked up, many are useful.

drop - This, obviously, is the opposite to take. If you no longer require an
       item, just drop it.

talk - This command allows you to interact with NPCs. Almost all NPCs will have
       something to say to you, and occasionally, it's important! Some NPCs also
       offer further options, such as buying or selling items, or quests.
       (Quests are tasks that you can undertake for the NPC. You prove that you
       have completed the task by returning a certain, quest-specific item to
       the NPC, upon which you will of course receive a reward.)

equip - Some items can be used as weapons. If you ever find yourself in a fight
        with a monster, you will want to have a weapon on you. However, just
        owning a weapon isn't enough. Before you can use it, you have to equip
        it with this command.

attack - Some places contain monsters. (In Atlantis, a "monster" is any hostile
         non-playing character.) While some monsters attack you first, you also
         have the choice of attacking them. After all, there may be rich
         treasure in store for the brave adventurer... (Make sure you have a
         weapon equipped, though!) When you attack a monster, or vice versa,
         the computer calculates the amount of damage you both take based on
         your various strengths and weapons. Make sure that your health doesn't
         drop too low! If it ever reaches 0, you're dead... (You can check up
         on your current health with the "look me" command. There may be some
         ways in-game of healing yourself - but you'll have to find those out
         for yourself.) Each time you use the "attack" command is equivalent to
         one round of fighting. Eventually, you'll kill the monster, or decide
         that discretion is the better part of valour...

clear - Sometimes, your screen can get rather cluttered up with the output of
        the various commands. With "clear" you delete all text except the place
        description.
