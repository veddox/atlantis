|| ATLANTIS README ||
=====================

Atlantis is a text-adventure game framework. It provides an interpreter to a
simple descriptive language (ATL) which can be used to create new game worlds,
and the user interface through which those worlds are explored. It also
includes one ready-made world (100 Acre Wood / Winnie the Pooh), with others
in development.


LAUNCHING

To run Atlantis, you need the CLISP Common Lisp interpreter. On Ubuntu, you
can install it with the command:

    sudo apt-get install clisp

You can then run Atlantis by executing the launcher bash script:

    ./atlantis.sh
