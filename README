|| ATLANTIS README ||
=====================

Atlantis is a text-based role-playing game framework. It provides an
interpreter to a simple descriptive language (ATL) which can be used to create
new game worlds, and the user interface through which those worlds are explored.

The aim is to give it multiplayer capabilities, so that several people can play
over a network. As Atlantis is still a very early stage of development, this
has not yet been implemented.

Contributions are welcome, simply submit a pull-request to the Github home page.
